## <a name="aboutme"> 🙋‍♀️ About me</a>
I used to dig through layers of earth to uncover the past and tell the stories hidden behind museum artifacts.
Now I dig through lines of code to secure the future and uncover bugs buried deep within software.

I’m a career switcher who found a passion for software testing for the same reasons I liked working in cultural heritage: curiosity, attention to detail, and the joy of discovering what lies beneath the surface.

I hold an ISTQB® Certified Tester certificate and am currently gaining hands-on experience in a real-world academic project at the Silesian University of Technology, where I work as a manual tester. In my free time, I explore testing tools, write SQL queries for fun, and learn Python scripting — because I believe good testers should always keep improving and never stop asking “what if?”

Looking for a passionate, adaptable, and quietly persistent junior tester?
I’m ready to click, break, question — and improve.

And here is a record of my path to becoming a professional software tester!

## <a name="API"> 🔌 API testing (Postman)</a>


📌 Trello API Testing Project

[⛓️‍💥 Project Github Repo](https://github.com/ewelinakolebuk/Trello-API-Testing-Project)

This project showcases practical API testing skills using Postman with Trello’s RESTful API. The test flow simulates a basic task management scenario involving the creation and manipulation of boards, lists, cards, labels, and checklists.

Key features tested:

✅ Creating, updating, retrieving, and deleting boards (POST, PUT, GET, DELETE)

📋 Managing lists and cards

🏷️ Adding and verifying labels

✔️ Handling checklists and check items

🧪 Asserting response status codes, data types, response times, and data integrity

The tests use collection and environment variables, pre-request scripts, and dynamic JavaScript assertions to ensure robust and maintainable API validation.
